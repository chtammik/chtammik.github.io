This is the source for my website at http://tammik.ca.

You can see the code in the repository running live here: http://chtammik.github.io.

It is built with using a simplistic design in HTML and CSS.

Feel free to copy, modify and use it to you liking.

Any suggestions & feedback are highly welcome at christopher@tammik.ca.

Love,

Maris
