				<h3>
					About
				</h3>
				<p>
					I'm a Sound Designer and Composer working in film and game audio. Always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and create experiences.
					</br>
					</br>
					My sound career started with a classical training in playing the Clarinet but during high school I discovered my passion for electronic music after dabbling in DJ-ing and I started getting into music production and sound design. After working in the audio realm for some years I decided I want to pursue this passion full on and get some education under my belt.
					</br>
					</br>
					Currently I am studying Sound Design at Vancouver Film School to deepen my knowledge about audio and discover new areas of sound for picture and games. The program spans all areas of the film production cycle including Production Sound, Dialogue Recording, <abbr title="Sound Effects">SFX</abbr> Editing, Sound Design, Foley, ADR & Mixing as well as game audio topics like implementation with Wwise and Fmod, the Unity and the Unreal Engines and dialogue stitching.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Allerdings
				</h3>
				<p>
					Allerdings is an experimental project for me to play with musical ideas, work with sound in new ways and dive deep into the possibilities of <abbr title="Digital Signal Processing">DSP</abbr> and Synthesis.
