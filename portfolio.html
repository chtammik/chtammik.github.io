If I'm not at the studio or at a meetup, chances are I'm hanging out at a game jam. Below is my game audio demo reel. Hit the "show more/less" button for more game audio projects I have worked on.

						<p>
							For my term 5 game audio assignment I teamed up with four other sound designers to create a 25 minute interactive audio book experience with branching story lines. This is a short overview of the dynamic music system I created out of stems with randomized sub tracks, tempo synced transition elements as well as playlist containers with differnt logic behavior.

						<p>
							For the Ludum Dare #33 Game Jam I decided to try make something in FMOD Studio. Within 48 hours I helped conceptualize and design a game, design all the SFX and write a piece of dynamic music that fades between two intenities of the same arrangement.

						<p>
							In collaboration with other sound designers and the students at the Vancouver Film School Game design Campus we created a 3v3 moba game. I composed the original music and implemented in Wwise. The music is randomized in multiple layers and the instrumentation changes based on the maximum amout of point any team has at any given point in time. The game is available for free at <a href="http://community.vfs.com/arcade/game/tib/">the VFS arcade</a>.

						<p><b>Man In The Woods - Music Re-Interpretation</b> - more info at <a href="https://vimeo.com/167390238">Vimeo</a></p>
						<p>
							I wrote this piece for a friend of mine doing a re-interpretation of the video "There is a man in the woods" (vimeo.com/93052696) as his graduation project at Vancouver Film School.
							</br>My friends narrator had a very different energy which called for a very different musical approach. It was a lot of fun creating a different atmosphere to this video and mixing the music in 5.1 surround sound:)

						<p>
							I wrote this piece for a friend of mine doing a re-interpretation of the sound design as his graduation project at Vancouver Film School. He asked me if I could supply a score that would fit his approach better and we collaborated in creating re-interpretation of this trailer with new voice actors, sound effects and music. It was a lot of fun creating a different atmosphere to this video and mixing the music in 5.1 surround sound:)

						<p><b>Entrip - Sound ReDesign</b> - more info at <a href="https://vimeo.com/148054745">Vimeo</a></p>
						<p>
							This project represents my graduation piece for my year at Vancouver Film School. I wrote the dialog script, cast actors, edited sound effects and created the entire soundscape from scratch. The music and dialog editorial was done in Ableton Live, the SFX were edited in Pro Tools (native) and the final mix in 5.1 surround sound was accomplished in Pro Tolls HD on a iCon Control-D.

						<p>
							This project was realized within a 24 hour period with limited resources and mixed in LCRS surround sound. To create vaiations of the 36 sound files that were provided with the video I used the <a href="http://kyma.symbolicsound.com/kyma-sound-design-environment/">KYMA</a> sound design engine and the <a href="http://www.tcelectronic.com/FireworX/">FireworX</a> hardware unit among other processing techniques.

						<p>
							At CeBit 2014 <a href="http://www.cppstudios.de/en/start/">CPP Studios</a> helped IBM Germany Showcasing projects in which data analyses helped grow businesses. I created sound design for hand drawn animations and wrote a 13 minute score. At the event I ran the live sound and processing.
