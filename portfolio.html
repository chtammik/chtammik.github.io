				</p>
				<p>
					A multiplayer action puzzle game I worked on in collaboration with "A Shell In The Pit". I was tasked with creating sound design for the entire game. I undertook two field recording trips, gathering custom sound effects in the woods. The game is releasing on Steam and Xbox One coming to other consoles later.

				<p>
					</br>
					A coop-only game with an novel and innovative control scheme. Each player uses the two anelouge sticks on the controller to navigate the body (representing health) and head ( used for attacks & solving puzzles) independently. I wrote an interactive music score and created sound design for the puzzle elements. Implemented took place in the Wwise middleware.  The game is available for free at <a href="http://community.vfs.com/arcade/game/headventures-in-the-underworld/">the VFS arcade</a>.

				<p><b>Sanity Music System in Wwise</b> - more info at <a href="https://vimeo.com/143584281">Vimeo</a></p>
				<p>
					For my term 5 game audio assignment at VFS I teamed up with four other sound designers to create a 25 minute interactive audio book experience with branching story lines. This is a short overview of the dynamic music system I created out of stems with randomized sub tracks, tempo synced transition elements as well as playlist containers with differnt logic behavior.

				<p>
					In collaboration with three other sound designers and the students at the Vancouver Film School Game design Campus we created a 3v3 MoBa game. I composed the original music and implemented it in Wwise. The music is randomized in multiple layers and the instrumentation changes based on the progression of the match. The game is available for free at <a href="http://community.vfs.com/arcade/game/tib/">the VFS arcade</a>.

				<p><b>Man In The Woods - Music Re-Interpretation</b> - more info at <a href="https://vimeo.com/167390238">Vimeo</a></p>
				<p>
					I wrote this piece for a friend of mine doing a re-interpretation of the video "There is a man in the woods" (<a href="vimeo.com/93052696">original video</a>) as his graduation project at Vancouver Film School.
					</br>My friends narrator had a very different energy which called for a very different musical approach. It was a lot of fun creating a different atmosphere to this video and mixing the music in 5.1 surround sound:)

				<p>
					This project represents my graduation piece for my year at Vancouver Film School. I wrote the dialog script, cast actors, edited sound effects and created the entire soundscape from scratch. The music and dialog editorial was done in Ableton Live, the SFX were edited in Pro Tools (native) and the final mix in 5.1 surround sound was accomplished in Pro Tolls HD on a iCon Control-D.

				<p><b>Need For Speed: Shift 2 (24hour Sound Re-Design)</b> - more info at <a href="https://vimeo.com/141091944">Vimeo</a></p>
				<p>
					This project was realized within a 24 hour period with limited resources and mixed in LCRS surround sound. To create vaiations of the 36 sound files that were provided with the video I used the <a href="http://kyma.symbolicsound.com/kyma-sound-design-environment/">KYMA</a> sound design engine and the <a href="http://www.tcelectronic.com/FireworX/">FireworX</a> hardware unit among other processing techniques.

				<p><b>Franky - Performance Installation</b> - more info at <a href="https://vimeo.com/107060348">Vimeo</a></p>
				<p>
					At CeBit 2014 <a href="http://www.cppstudios.de/en/start/">CPP Studios</a> helped IBM Germany Showcasing projects in which data analyses helped grow businesses. I created sound design for hand drawn animations and wrote an original 15 minute score balancing between clasical instrumentation and digital beats. At the event I ran the live sound and processing for the moderators as well as the live tracked actor for Franky, the robot assitant in the show.
