				<h3>
					About
				</h3>
				<p>
					My sound career started with a classical training in playing the Clarinet but during high school I discovered my passion for electronic music. After dabbling in DJ-ing I soon started getting into music production and sound design. After working in advertising for some years I decided to study post production for. During my studies at <a href="http://vfs.edu/programs/sound-design">Vancouver Film School</a> I deiscovered game audio as my passion and focused on developing my implementation skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am experienced in Audiokinetic's <a href="https://www.audiokinetic.com/products/wwise/">Wwise</a> and Firelight's <a href="http://www.fmod.org/products/">Fmod Studio</a> Implementation Software and I have worked with both the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity">Unity</a> and the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal</a> Game Engines.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am knowledgable about all areas of the film production cycle including Production Sound & ADR Recording, Sound Effects Editing, Sound Design, Foley and Mixing.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Allerdings
				</h3>
				<p>
					Allerdings is an experimental project for me to play with musical ideas, work with sound in new ways and dive deep into the possibilities of Digital Signal Processing and Synthesis.
					</br>Most of these experiments are published on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/allerdings">my Soundcloud profile</a>.
